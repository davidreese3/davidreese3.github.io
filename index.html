            <p>
                Hello! I'm David Reese, a software engineer and educator with a strong background in full-stack development, Spring Boot, and database management.
                I recently completed my Master of Science in Software Engineering at The University of Scranton, graduating in May 2025. 
                My thesis project was RecipEase, a recipe-sharing platform designed to help users create, explore, and share recipes easily.

                I also earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2024. 
                During my time at the university, I was an active member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, serving as treasurer during my undergraduate years and later as vice president during graduate school. 
                In addition, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant in the Computing Sciences department, helping students in labs and offering academic support.
                Outside the classroom, I was heavily involved in campus life, participating in New Student Orientation, Student Government, and working as a peer tutor.
