            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a dedicated software engineer with experience in Spring Boot, database management, and full-stack development. 
                I am currently pursuing my graduate studies in Software Engineering at The University of Scranton, with an expected graduation in May 2025.
                My Master's thesis is an application called "RecipEase" that is a recipe sharing platform. 
                I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science last May and am an active member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, serving as my chapter's treasurer. 
                Additionally, I work as a graduate teaching assistant for the Computing Sciences department. 
                During my undergraduate studies, I was actively involved in campus life, participating in programs such as New Student Orientation and Student Government, while also working as a peer tutor.
